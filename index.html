                        Welcome to my portfolio! I am a student at the University of British Columbia studying Computer Science.
                        My specialty is in web development but I am always looking to learn new things.
                        <br><br>
                        I take pride in my work and often chase opportunities to conquer new challenges.
                        In my free time I love to create whether that is 
                        writing music, making art, videogames, stories, and even using my computer knowledge to create tools to help power productivity in my own life!

                        I started programming in Junior high, eventually journeying into the IB Computer Science Program where 
                        I learned how to fully develop applications, but my real surge of passion was when I learned app development. 
                        My minor in psychology helped me excel in Human Computer interaction, and making adapative and capable systems became my new passion.
